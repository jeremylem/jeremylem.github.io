**SOLUTION ARCHITECT / SENIOR LEAD SOFTWARE ENGINEER** Oct 2010 -- Dec 2024

**J.P. Morgan Private Bank** , Geneva, Switzerland

##### Achievements

- Engineered Authentication Security & Access: This involved architecting, integrating, and deploying two authentication solutions for web and mobile, with seamless client migration. High availability and resilience were ensured across two data centers, in compliance with regulations.

- Developed Strategic E-Signature Capabilities: Designed and led the implementation of a compliant e-signature solution, streamlining digital signature processes for clients to buy structured bank products, while ensuring adherence to Swiss banking secrecy.

- Led Cross-Functional Project Delivery: This included coordinating offshore development teams, partnering with business sponsors to define requirements, reviewing vendor contracts, and collaborating with infrastructure, security, and legal teams to deliver complex, high-impact projects.

- Addressed Complex Security Challenges: Collaborated with Ethical Hacking teams for dynamic scans and proactively remediated security vulnerabilities. Partnered with cryptographic and mobile committees to ensure robust security for client-facing applications.

##### Key Responsibilities

###### Development & Architecture

- Led the development of a RESTful, service-oriented layer to modernize the client website, applying stringent code quality, test coverage, and security protocols.

- Architected and implemented core components for legally compliant e-signature solutions (QuoVadis), involving advanced cryptographic implementations to adhere to Swiss banking secrecy and regulatory requirements.

- Engineered native mobile authentication solutions in Swift (iOS) and Java (Android) by reverse engineering-existing JavaScript libraries, integrating biometric authentication (TouchID/FaceID).

- Developed and implemented the core integration layers for multi-factor authentication systems (Arcot, Ezio) across web and mobile platforms.

- Architected and implemented a Session DNA solution utilizing digital signatures and business rules to prevent parallel logins, ensuring compliance with Mexican regulations.

- Developed and deployed a generic e-signature service on Kubernetes using Entrust, to streamline the digital signature process.

- Integrated a third-party communication platform to facilitate communication between clients, CSS/Bankers, and Investors. Developed Java-based integration services and later migrated the frontend from AngularJS to ReactJS to align with company coding standards.

- For the Engage project, which aimed to facilitate direct client investments, developed several services, including document distribution and the integration of client notifications through Apache Kafka.

###### Leadership & Team Coordination

- Led and mentored a team of offshore developers, coordinating user stories and delivery.

- Conducted code reviews for junior developers, promoting secure coding practices with the introduction of static code scans.

- Collaborated with business sponsors to translate strategic objectives into clear project requirements and define delivery expectations.

- Planned iterations, provided estimates, and groomed user stories.

- Collaborated with project managers to review and enhance SDLC practices, ensuring robust compliance with software development lifecycle standards.

- Managed coordination with the Ethical Hacking Team for dynamic security scans and facilitated the remediation of identified vulnerabilities with offshore development teams.

- Engaged with the legal department to conduct comprehensive reviews of vendor contracts, ensuring all projects adhered to legal and regulatory compliance.

###### Integration & Migration

- Executed the deployment and upgrade of the Ezio server appliance (HSM) and developed the critical server-side SiteMinder plugin in Java for client authentication.

- Orchestrated the migration of Swiss client services from Sybase to MS SQL Server.

- Led a proof of concept for deploying the Apache Mailet application on Kubernetes, modernizing the deployment strategy by moving from virtual machines to the on-premise cloud.

###### Infrastructure & Deployment

- Collaborated with infrastructure teams to provision backend, web, and database instances, deploying multiple vendor products across data centres with automated deployment scripts.

- Configured Apache instances for both internal and external websites.

- Partnered with the infrastructure team to address security issues found during the pentests.

###### Security & Compliance

- Worked closely with Risk and Control teams on cryptographic key management and operational procedures for the HSM appliance, supporting the deployment of the Gemalto solution.

- Ensured the security of the Authentication systems in collaboration with the security and control teams, successfully completing multiple security tests.

- Maintained a secure client data storage solution for MS SQL Server, integrating it with a Swiss-specific key management service (KMS) to ensure data confidentiality and regulatory compliance.

- Managed and reviewed ongoing static code analysis, including false positive triage, to ensure adherence to secure coding practices.

- Oversaw the security of mobile authentication solutions, presenting designs to the cryptographic and mobile committees.
